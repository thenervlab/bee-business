Photo taking guide
It's time to take a photo of your bee hotel! The goal is to take clear photos that show the entire interior of the bee hotel (without disturbing bees), including all nests (even empty ones), and the hotel and nest codes at the top.

1.	Before you start

    Open the curtain cord and lid panel to reveal the interior. Do not move or pick up the hotel.

2.	Set up the shot (composition)

    Include the whole hotel in frame: all nests + the hotel code(s) at the top.

    Hold the camera square to the hotel (not tilted) so rows look straight.

    Tap to focus (on phones) on the nest area; wait for focus to lock.
    
    *Tip: Having trouble with the focus? Try stand back a little and zoom in if needed.*

3.	Lighting (especially at night)

    We recommend taking some photos at night, when the bees are home, and therefore a lighting source may be required.

    Option 1: Use a light source (friend's torch, headlamp, porch light). Aim the light from the side/at an angle to reduce glare; avoid shining light straight into the lens.
    
    Option 2: Using camera flash — but make sure you check for glare. If you see bright hotspots, try angling the light or taking one step sideways.

4.	Take the photo

    Take at least two photos per hotel from the same position in case one is blurry.

    Tap: Hold steady — brace against a post/wall or use a 3–10 second timer to prevent blur.

5.	Time and metadata

    Phones: The date/time and camera details are saved automatically. You can confirm by opening the photo and tapping “i” (info).
    
    Cameras: Check settings to ensure the date/time are correct before shooting.

6.	Quality check (before uploading)

    Can you clearly see all nest holes and the hotel code(s)?
    
    Is the image sharp and well lit?
    
    Is as much of the internal structure visible as possible?

7.	Upload

    Upload directly from your phone or transfer from camera to a computer and then upload. You can access the upload portal here (link).
    
    Please do not delete any photos you've uploaded until the project ends.
