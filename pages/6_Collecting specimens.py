st.write("""
The accurate identification of each species occupying the observation hotels is critical to the success of this project. If neither you or the research team can identify the species occupying your hotels from photos, then you may be asked to collect specimens for further identification and potential DNA barcoding.

st.markdown("""
- Adult nesting bees and wasps.

- Newly emerged adult bees and wasps.

- Parasite species entering or flying around the nest entrances (and observations of their behaviour).

st.subheader("When to collect")
st.write("""
To ensure that individuals are not disrupted during their active phase (brood provisioning and brood rearing), it is best to collect a single adult specimen (i.e. the mother or newly emerged adults) at the end of this active period. For most species this will be around late February to early March. The research team can advise on the best time to collect if you are unsure.

st.subheader("How to collect")
st.write("""
We will be provide a small handful of 1.5 ml vials with each observation hotel sent out. To collect an individual specimen, we recommend taping an open 2 ml vial to the outside of the nest entrance and waiting for the bee to enter the vial and then placing the lid on the vial. 

If you have access to an aspirator, this can be used to carefully extract individuals from the nest entrance. Feel free to construct a simple insect aspirator yourself using a large vial and rubber tubing (at least 5 mm in diameter). See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fvHtVUHyik

st.subheader("Preservation")
st.write("""
Collected specimens should be humanely killed by placing the 2 ml vial into a freezer for 24 hours. Collected specimens should be stored in a freezer until they are able to be sent via mail. If possible, specimens can be stored in 99% ethanol (but please discuss with the research team before sourcing ethanol and undertaking this step). 
""")

st.subheader("Where to send specimens")
st.write("""
Once you have collected specimens and discussed with your researcher the ins and outs of this we should have a reasonable idea of where they should get sent! Depending on the taxon, some of our research team might be better equipped than others to make a diagnosis. Sometimes even the research team might struggle and will perhaps ask for external help as well. So, this might require a little bit of discussion.
