We should preface this section with 'bee identification is hard' and that it involves developing a distinct set of skills and terminology. That being said, the way to get better is to practice and to ask for help! 

Thankfully, there is a community of people out there that are willing to help and we are here to help as well. When it comes to identifying bees from photos, it can be possible, although not always. If you want help through photos please be sure to take excellent and clear photos of the face, dorsal (back of the) thorax, and abdomen (this is often easier said than done). We may also then ask you to go back and take more photos of specific features, depending on the bee. 

Alternatively, it is often easier to ifentify bees from specimens and we did send most of you a small handful of vials. 

Hi Beeple, so you've got native bees in your bee hotel (yay) but what species are they?

We will help you ID your native bees — please if you can provide high resolution photos of the face, dorsal thorax, and abdomen (I know, easier said than done!)

There's a lot out there in terms of scientific literature and bee taxonomy as well. Some [somewhat] accessible resources are below.
