This guide is specifically for the bee hotels that are getting sent out by our core team, but I will also include some guidance for installing your own hotels for inclusion in the project. I will call the core team hotels “JBD” hotels as they will all start with the code 25**JBD**BH…""")

For the JBD hotels, I have provided a mounting solution in the form of an L-bracket on either side of the hotel. You can feel free to remove these if you’d like and come up with your own, but I think that these will work in most situations. I have also provided some wood screws for you to use.

st.write("""
You will also have a piece of black curtain stretchy cord that can hook over the top of the hotel to keep it closed tightly. One side will have a zip-tie on it to help you to close the hotel easier and the other side will not. I would recommend using a pair of pliers to close the non-zip-tie side over the bottom (downward-facing) loop of your hotel. This way you can easily take it off by pulling it forward over the lip of the hotel and the whole thing won’t fly off into the dark.

st.write("""
I have also provided a small handful of vials and tear-off label sheets. Put these aside somewhere that you won’t lose them and, if the need arises, you can collect some specimens to send to us for identification. We will talk about this on an individual basis, but the idea would be to collect bees into them and immediately freeze them to reduce stress and help to preserve DNA.

st.subheader("How to install")
st.write("""
Feel free to show some initiative here, but here are a few thoughts, tips, and requirements for the project. 
""")

st.markdown("1. The hotels should be installed 1–2 m from the ground. However, if you've only got a balcony (like I do above), then it should be installed at or below the level of the local canopy (i.e. where you might still expect bees to be foraging; record this for us). ")
st.markdown("2. The hotel should be facing Somewhere between north and east — most phones have a compass app and this would be between 0º and 90º heading (record this heading for us). This facing should help the bees get the morning sun")
st.markdown("3.	Try to avoid intense midday and afternoon sunlight. ")
st.markdown("4.	The JBD hotels can’t be mounted on a completely flat surface because the door needs to be able to open from behind. Just test that you can open the door before you begin installation. A post, tree, or the corner of a flat surface could work well. ")
st.markdown("5.	The JBD hotels can be mounted either vertically (as above) or horizontally (record this for us).")
st.markdown("6.	Put your hotel somewhere that’s convenient for you. We don’t want the data collection to become a drain on you and so putting the hotel where you’re happy to look frequently and record data is encouraged!")
st.markdown("7. Consider not putting both of your hotels in the exact same spot. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, we want to spread our chances of bees finding the hotel. Secondly, we want to spread out the parasite pressure. Thirdly, we don't want you to get confused about which hotel you're enterrign data for.")
st.markdown("8.	Finally, once you’ve decided where you’re going to put it (and you can decide to change, just discuss with us first), you can line the hotel up where you want it and use a pencil to mark where the four screws will go through the two L-brackets. You should consider pre-drilling the holes with a small (2.5–3 mm) drill bit. Once you have done this you can easily use the screws provided (or your own) to screw in all four screws and you’re almost done! ")

st.subheader("Initial data collection")
st.write("""
Once you have installed your hotel we will ask for a few bits of data that you should only need to collect once per installation and per hotel.  
""")
st.markdown("1.	Record the hotel code! This is an important first step as everything you do will relate back to this code.")
st.markdown("2.	Take an image of the nest and where it is. We will include this image on the website so that when you go to enter your data you get a picture of the nest, where it’s installed, to help reduce erroneous data entry.")
st.markdown("3.	Record the height from the ground.")
st.markdown("4.	Record the heading in degrees from north. North is zero degrees, east is 90º, south is 180º, and west is 270º.")
st.markdown("5.	Record if the hotel is mounted vertically or horizontally.")
st.markdown("6.	Record the latitude and longitude. You can do this on an app on your phone, or on Google Maps. If you aren’t sure how to get the coordinates from Google maps, you can just click where your hotel is on the map and then share that location or link with us and we can do it for you! ")

st.subheader("What if you have your own observation hotels?")
st.write("""
First of all, great! I don’t know if the JBD hotels will work as we are hoping they will. I don’t know if this is the best design for native bees or for the masked bees. So, including some other hotels in the mix is a wonderful thing. However, we need to include them in the same way that we include all of the others so that we can standardise and compare. Remember, data is the core of how we will analyse our findings! 
""")
st.markdown("""
1.	Create a UNIQUE code for each hotel. This must be done in communication with one of us and I suggest the following structure that is consistent with how I have named the JBD hotels. 

    a.	Start with the year — mine begin with “25” for “2025” (the year that they were produced).

    b.	Use your initials — mine are “JBD” and so now we know who made or deployed them.

    c.	Add “BH” to indicate that the data are associated with a bee hotel — remember, we actually collect data in many different ways and this is just a nice little hint to show us, at an immediate glance, how the data were produced.

    d.	Then a number. I used “01”, “02”, …, “20”. Adding a zero at the start means that we can have up to 99 hotels using the same code and makes it possible to easily sort the hotels in programs like Excel.

    e.	Hence, a full code for one of my bee hotels might be 25JBDBH06.

2.	Each one of the holes in your bee hotel should also be assigned a letter (a, b, c …, z). In this way, we can easily append our bee hotel code later and identify the exact hotel and nest hole together! For example, the third nest hole’s code would eventually become 25JBDBH06c. 
3.	Write your code on your hotel. 

    a.	I have written the full code (e.g., 25JBDBH06) on both the top and the front of the hotels so that when you take photos they will be included. This should always be visible in your data entry photos (as bottom left).

    b.	On the front (and top) of my hotels I have then written each letter at the nest entrance so that when you take photos of bees at the front it is immediately apparent to which hole it belongs.

4.	For each letter (nest hole) let us know the diameter of the holes (in millimetres) so that they can also be recorded and associated with the data.
5.	Let us know the materials that were used in the construction of the hotel.
